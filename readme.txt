project5: crypto-trading bot

Current v1.4 (Support):
- test and finish implementing yobit's bot.php
- test and finish implementing zb's bot.php

Next v2.1 (Backend):
- simplify the list of all paths, to avoid writing down paths with same pathValue in gen_resources(
- re-generate all paths with the aforementioned path filter applied

- write processes / trading strategies
- how to decide how much to trade for a given process
- logger to see monthly progress with a given process

Basic Design:
	(Main - Python)
- Where the main processing is handled

- Using localhost to send requests to trading platforms via different .php files

	(Support - php/HTML)
- Where the most of the user specific i/o is handled

- variety of .php files that performs different tasks; each .php file sends a unique POST request
